You are implementing the DEPO method from depo.md.
CoreNLP parses a selectively masked question: only complex long entities may be replaced by EntityA/EntityB.
Type variables and syntactic scaffold words stay in natural language.
After parsing, entity/type-variable token spans are folded into anchor supernodes on the dependency graph.
The MST is an anchor-only MST over entity/type-variable anchor nodes.
Do not do ordinary end-to-end subquestion decomposition.
Do only the current pipeline step.
Do not introduce entities or type variables that are not present in the original question.
Do not merge repeated variables when they have different semantic roles.
The output must be valid parseable JSON and nothing else.

Current step: identify entity nodes and type-variable nodes only.
Do not generate subquestions.
Extract minimal relation-bearing anchor nodes for dependency-graph inspection, not full descriptive noun phrases.
Assign each node a natural-language CamelCase placeholder in the format SemanticType + GreekOrdinal.
Use Greek ordinals in this order: Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon, Zeta, Eta, Theta.
Examples: CompanyAlpha, PersonAlpha, PersonBeta, FilmAlpha, FilmBeta, NationalityAlpha.
Use EntityAlpha only when no more specific semantic type is natural.
For repeated mentions with different roles, keep separate nodes with separate placeholders.
For type variables, use the shortest surface span that still names the relation endpoint correctly.
Prefer the head role/category for organization, institution, place, person, and title endpoints.
Keep pre-head words only when they form an essential functional/common-noun term; remove field, topic, quality, domain, purpose, or scope modifiers.
Do not omit a functional/structural nominal endpoint just because it is introduced as an attributed property or predicate complement.
Return exact character spans in the original question whenever possible, using Python-style start inclusive and end exclusive.
These original spans will be shifted after selective masking and then aligned to CoreNLP tokens, so span accuracy is critical.

Extract only the core entity and type-variable nodes for this question.

Definitions:
- entity: a concrete named entity or named artifact explicitly named in the question.
- type_variable: a minimal role, title, office, answer type, object type, institution type, system, artifact, place type, or other common-noun concept that acts as an endpoint in the question's relation chain.

Rules:
- Do not generate atomic subquestions.
- Do not output relations.
- Do not invent nodes not explicitly supported by the question text.
- Extract only relation-bearing graph anchors: named entities, answer types, roles/titles/offices, institutions, places, systems, artifacts, and object/category concepts that are endpoints of predicates, possessives, clauses, or prepositional relations.
- Always include explicit role/title/office mentions when they participate in a relation, including abbreviations and uppercase titles. Do not drop a role just because it is attached to another node by a possessive, "of", or relative-clause relation.
- For each type_variable, choose the shortest contiguous span that still names the endpoint correctly. Remove determiners and nonessential adjectives.
- Include nominal predicate complements and attributed/possessed things when they are themselves functional, structural, institutional, artifact, system, place, or role endpoints in the relation chain. They remain anchors even if the surrounding clause describes a property of another node.
- For organization, institution, place, person, and role/title endpoints, the head category or title is normally the node. Remove preceding field, industry, topic, domain, quality, purpose, scope, and descriptive modifiers unless the whole phrase is a proper named entity.
- For functional or structural common-noun endpoints, keep a compact compound span only when the pre-head word changes the endpoint class and the head alone would be too vague for the relation chain. Keep only essential compound words; remove determiners, quality adjectives, clauses, and prepositional complements.
- If a word or phrase only describes, restricts, classifies, quantifies, dates, measures, or gives the topic/domain/purpose of another anchor, do not extract it as a standalone node unless the question directly asks for that value. This pruning applies to the modifiers and complements around an anchor, not to the anchor noun phrase itself.
- Do not extract objects inside modifier/complement phrases as separate nodes when they are only topical restrictions or purposes of another endpoint.
- Do not extract quantities, durations, dates, ordinals, comparative words, or measurement phrases as standalone nodes unless the question directly asks for that value as the answer.
- Before returning, prune every multi-word type_variable span: if removing a pre-head word leaves a valid role/category endpoint of the same relation, output the shorter span; if removing it changes a functional/structural endpoint into a vague generic noun, keep the compact compound.
- Keep duplicate role variables separate when they belong to different branches or distinct mentions with different roles.
- Preserve exact surface text from the original question.
- Return accurate start/end character offsets for each surface span in the original question.
- Prefer semantic placeholders like PersonAlpha for CEO/director, FilmAlpha for films, CompanyAlpha for companies.
